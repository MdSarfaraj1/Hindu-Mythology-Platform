  Definition:
    "The Mahabharata is an ancient Indian epic where the main story revolves around two branches of a family - the Pandavas and Kauravas - who, in the Kurukshetra War, battle for the throne of Hastinapura. Interwoven into this narrative are several smaller stories about people dead or living, and philosophical discourses. Krishna-Dwaipayan Vyasa, himself a character in the epic, composed it; as, according to tradition, he dictated the verses and Ganesha wrote them down. At 100,000 verses, it is the longest epic poem ever written, generally thought to have been composed in the 4th century BCE or earlier. The events in the epic play out in the Indian subcontinent and surrounding areas. It was first narrated by a student of Vyasa at a snake-sacrifice of the great-grandson of one of the major characters of the story. Including within it the Bhagavad Gita, the Mahabharata is one of the most important texts of ancient Indian, indeed world, literature.",

        content: ` Shantanu, the king of Hastinapur, was married to Ganga (personification of the Ganges) with whom he had a son called Devavrat. Several years later, when Devavrat had grown up to be an accomplished prince, Shantanu fell in love with Satyavati. Her father refused to let her marry the king unless the king promised that Satyavati's son and descendants would inherit the throne. Unwilling to deny Devavrat his rights, Shantanu declined to do so but the prince, on coming to know of the matter, rode over to Satyavati's house, vowed to renounce the throne and to remain celibate throughout his life. The prince then took Satyavati home to the palace so that the king, his father, could marry her. On account of the terrible vow that he'd taken that day, Devavrat came to be known as Bheeshm. Shantanu was so pleased with his son that he granted to Devavrat the boon of choosing the time of his own death. 
        In time, Shantanu and Satyavati had two sons.Soon thereafter, Shantanu died.Satyavati's sons still being minors, the affairs of the kingdom were managed by Bheeshm and Satyavati. By the time these sons reached adulthood, the elder one had died in a skirmish with some gandharvas (heavenly beings) so the younger son, Vichitravirya, was enthroned. Bheeshm then abducted the three princesses of a neighbouring kingdom and brought them over to Hastinapur to be wedded to Vichitravirya. The eldest of these princesses declared that she was in love with someone else, so she was let go; the two other princesses were married to Vichitravirya who died soon afterwards, childless`},

      name: `Dhritarashtra, Pandu & Vidur`,
      content: `So that the family line did not die out, Satyavati summoned her son Vyasa to impregnate the two queens. Vyasa had been born to Satyavati of a great sage named Parashar before her marriage to Shantanu. According to the laws of the day, a child born to an unwed mother was taken to be a step-child of the mother's husband; by that token, Vyasa could be considered Shantanu's son and could be used to perpetuate the Kuru clan that ruled Hastinapur. Thus, by the Niyog custom, the two queens each had a son of Vyasa: to the elder queen was born a blind son called Dhritarashtra, and to the younger was born an otherwise healthy but extremely pale son called Pandu. To a maid of these queens was born a son of Vyasa called Vidur. Bheeshm brought up these three boys with great care. Dhritarashtra grew up to be the strongest of all princes in the country, Pandu was extremely skilled in warfare and archery, and Vidur knew all the branches of learning, politics, and statesmanship.

With the boys grown, it was now time to fill up the empty throne of Hastinapur. Dhritarashtra, the eldest, was bypassed because the laws barred a disabled person from being king. Pandu, instead, was crowned. Bheeshm negotiated Dhritarashtra's marriage with Gandhari, and Pandu's with Kunti and Madri. Pandu expanded the kingdom by conquering the sorrounding areas, and brought in considerable war booty. With things running smoothly in the country, and with its coffers full, Pandu asked his elder brother to look after the state affairs, and retired to the forests with his two wives for some time off.`,

      name: "Kauravas & PAndavas",
      content: `A few years later, Kunti returned to Hastinapur. With her were five little boys, and the bodies of Pandu and Madri. The five boys were the sons of Pandu, born to his two wives through the Niyog custom from gods: the eldest was born of Dharma, the second of Vayu, the third of Indra, and the youngest - twins - of the Ashvins. In the meanwhile, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari too had had children of their own: 100 sons and one daughter. The Kuru elders performed the last rites for Pandu and Madri, and Kunti and the children were welcomed into the palace.<br>
    All of the 105 princes were subsequently entrusted to the care of a teacher: Kripa at first and, additionally, Drona later. Drona's school at Hastinapur attracted several other boys; Karna, of the Suta clan was one such boy. It was here that hostilities quickly developed between the sons of Dhritarashtra (collectively called the Kauravas, patronymic of their ancestor Kuru) and the sons of Pandu (collectively called the Pandavas, patronymic of their father).<br>

Duryodhana, the eldest Kaurava, tried - and failed - to poison Bheem, the second Pandava. Karna, because of his rivalry in archery with the third Pandava, Arjuna, allied himself with Duryodhan. In time, the princes learnt all they could from their teachers, and the Kuru elders decided to hold a public skills exhibition of the princes. It was during this exhibition that the citizens became plainly aware of the hostilities between the two branches of the royal family: Duryodhan and Bheem had a mace fight that had to be stopped before things turned ugly, Karna - uninvited as he was not a Kuru prince - challenged Arjuna, was insulted on account of his non-royal birth, and was crowned king of a vassal state on the spot by Duryodhan. It was also around this time that questions began to be raised about Dhritarashtra occupying the throne, since he was supposed to be holding it only in trust for Pandu, the crowned king. To keep peace in the realm, Dhritarashtra declared the eldest Pandava, Yudhishthir, as the crown prince and heir apparent.`,

      name: "The first exile",
      content: `Yudhishthir's being the crown prince and his rising popularity with the citizens was extremely distasteful to Duryodhan, who saw himself as the rightful heir since his father was the de facto king. He plotted to get rid of the Pandavas. This he did by getting his father to send the Pandavas and Kunti off to a nearby town on the pretext of a fair that was held there. The palace in which the Pandavas were to stay in that town was built by an agent of Duryodhan; the palace was made entirely of inflammable materials since the plan was to burn down the palace - together with the Pandavas and Kunti - once they'd settled in. The Pandavas, however, were alerted to this fact by their other uncle, Vidur, and had a counter plan ready; they dug an escape tunnel underneath their chambers. One night, the Pandavas gave out a huge feast which all of the townsfolk came to. At that feast, a forest woman and her five sons found themselves so well-fed and well-drunk that they could no longer walk straight; they passed out on the floor of the hall. That very night, the Pandavas themselves set fire to the palace and escaped through the tunnel. When the flames had died down, the townsfolk discovered the bones of the forest woman and her boys, and mistook them for Kunti and the Pandavas. Duryodhan thought his plan had succeeded and that the world was free of the Pandavas.`,

      name: "Arjuna & Draupadi",
      content: `Meanwhile, the Pandavas and Kunti went into hiding, moving from one place to another and passing themselves off as a poor brahmin family. They would seek shelter with some villager for a few weeks, the princes would go out daily to beg for food, return in the evenings and hand over the day's earnings to Kunti who would divide the food into two: one half was for the strongman Bheem and the other half was shared by the others. During these wanderings, Bheem killed two demons, married a demoness, and had a demon child called Ghatotkach. They then heard about a swayamvar (a ceremony to choose a suitor) being organised for the princess of Panchal, and went at Panchal to see the festivities. According to their practice, they left their mother home and set out for alms: they reached the swayamvar hall where the king was giving away things most lavishly to alms seekers. The brothers sat themselves down in the hall to watch the fun: the princess Draupadi, born of fire, was famed for her beauty and every prince from every country for miles around had come to the swayamvar, hoping to win her hand. The conditions of the swayamvar were difficult: a long pole on the ground had a circular contraption spinning at its top. On this moving disc was attached a fish. At the bottom of the pole was a shallow urn of water. A person had to look down into this water-mirror, use the bow and five arrows that were provided, and pierce the fish spinning on top. Five attempts were allowed. It was evident that only an extremely skilled archer, such as the now-presumed-dead Arjuna, could pass the test.<br>
    One by one, the kings and princes tried to shoot the fish, and failed. Some could not even lift the bow; some could not string it. The Kauravas and Karna were also present. Karna picked up the bow and strung it in a moment, but was prevented from taking aim when Draupadi declared she would not marry anyone from the Suta clan. After every one of the royals had failed, Arjuna, the third Pandava, stepped up to the pole, picked up the bow, strung it, affixed all of the five arrows to it, looked down into the water, aimed, shot, and pierced the fish's eye with all of the five arrows in a single attempt. Arjuna had won Draupadi's hand.<br>
    The Pandava brothers, still in the guise of poor brahmins, took Draupadi back to the hut they were staying at and shouted for Kunti, "Ma, Ma, come and see what we've brought back today." Kunti, saying, "Whatever it is, share it among yourselves", came out of the hut, saw that it wasn't alms but the most beautiful woman she had ever set her eyes on, and stood stock still as the import of her words sank in on everybody present.<br>
    Meanwhile, Draupadi's twin Dhrishtadyumna, unhappy that his royal sister should be married off to a poor commoner, had secretly followed the Pandavas back to their hut. Also following them secretly was a dark prince and his fair brother - Krishna and Balaram of the Yadava clan - who had suspected that the unknown archer could be none other than Arjuna, who had been presumed dead at the palace-burning incident several months ago. These princes were related to the Pandavas - their father was Kunti's brother - but they had never met before. By design or happenstance, Vyasa also arrived at the scene at this point and the Pandava hut was alive for a while with happy cries of meetings and reunions. To keep Kunti's words, it was decided that Draupadi would be the common wife of all of the five Pandavas. Her brother, Dhrishtadyumna, and her father, the king Drupad, were reluctant with this unusual arrangement but were talked around to it by Vyasa and Yudhishthir.`,

      name: "Indraprastha & the dice game",
      content: `After the wedding ceremonies at Panchal were over, the Hastinapur palace invited the Pandavas and their bride back. Dhritarashtra made a great show of happiness on discovering that the Pandavas were alive after all, and he partitioned the kingdom, giving them a huge tract of barren land to settle in and rule over. The Pandavas transformed this land into a paradise. Yudhishthir was crowned there, and he performed a sacrifice that involved all of the kings of the land to accept - either voluntarily or by force - his suzerainty. The new kingdom, Indraprastha, prospered.<br>
    Meanwhile, the Pandavas had entered into an agreement among themselves regarding Draupadi: she was to be wife of each Pandava, by turn, for a year. If any Pandava was to enter the room where she was present with her husband-of-that-year, that Pandava was to be exiled for 12 years. It so happened that once Draupadi and Yudhishthir, her husband of that year, were present in the armoury when Arjuna entered it to take his bow and arrows. Consequently, he went off in exile during which he toured the entire country, down to its southernmost tip, and married three princesses he met along the way.<br>
    The prosperity of Indraprastha and the power of the Pandavas was not something that Duryodhan liked. He invited Yudhisthir to a dice game and got his uncle, Shakuni, to play on his (Duryodhan's) behalf. Shakuni was an accomplished player; Yudhishthir staked - and lost - step by step his entire wealth, his kingdom, his brothers, himself, and Draupadi. Draupadi was dragged into the dice hall and insulted. There was an attempt to disrobe her, and Bheem lost his temper and vowed to kill each and every one of the Kauravas. Things came to such a boil that Dhritarashtra intervened unwillingly, gave the kingdom and their freedom back to the Pandavas and Draupadi, and set them off back to Indraprastha. This angered Duryodhan, who talked his father around, and invited Yudhishthir to another dice game. This time, the condition was that the loser would go on a 12-year exile followed by a year of life incognito. If they were to be discovered during this incognito period, the loser would have to repeat the 12+1 cycle. The dice game was played. Yudhishthir lost again.`,

      name: "The second exile",
      content: `For this exile, the Pandavas left their ageing mother Kunti behind at Hastinapur, in Vidur's place. They lived in forests, hunted game, and visited holy spots. At around this time, Yudhishthir asked Arjuna to go to the heavens in quest of celestial weapons because, by now, it was apparent that their kingdom would not be returned to them peacefully after the exile and that they would have to fight for it. Arjuna did so, and not only did he learn the techniques of several divine weapons from the gods, he also learnt how to sing and dance from the gandharvas.<br>
    After 12 years, the Pandavas went incognito for a year. During this one-year period, they lived in the Virat kingdom. Yudhishthir took up employment as a king's counsellor, Bheem worked in the royal kitchens, Arjuna turned himself into a eunuch and taught the palace maidens how to sing and dance, the twins worked at the royal stables, and Draupadi became a handmaiden to the queen. At the end of the incognito period - during which they were not discovered despite Duryodhan's best efforts - the Pandavas revealed themselves. The Virat king was overwhelmed; he offered his daughter in marriage to Arjuna but he declined since he had been her dance teacher the past year and students were akin to children. The princess was married, instead, to Arjuna's son Abhimanyu.<br>
    At this wedding ceremony, a large number of Pandava allies gathered to draw out a war strategy. Meanwhile, emissaries had been sent to Hastinapur to demand Indraprastha back but the missions had failed. Krishna himself went on a peace mission and failed. Duryodhan refused to give away as much land as was covered by the point of a needle, let alone the five villages proposed by the peace missions. The Kauravas also gathered their allies around them, and even broke away a key Pandava ally - the maternal uncle of the Pandava twins - by trickery. War became inevitable.`,

      content: `Just before the war bugle was sounded, Arjuna saw arrayed before him his relatives: his great-grandfather Bheeshm who had practically brought him up, his teachers Kripa and Drona, his brothers the Kauravas, and, for a moment, his resolution wavered. Krishna, the warrior par excellence, had given up arms for this war and had elected to be Arjuna's charioteer. To him Arjuna said, "Take me back, Krishna. I can't kill these people. They're my father, my brothers, my teachers, my uncles, my sons. What good is a kingdom that's gained at the cost of their lives?" Then followed a philosophical discourse that has today become a separate book on its own - the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna explained the impermanence of life to Arjuna, and the importance of doing one's duty and of sticking to the right path. Arjuna picked up his bow again<br>
    <br>The battle raged for 18 days. The army totalled 18 akshauhinis, 7 on the Panadava side and 11 on the Kaurava (1 akshauhini = 21,870 chariots + 21,870 elephants + 65,610 horses + 109,350 soldiers on foot). Casualties on both sides were high. When it all ended, the Pandavas had won the war but lost almost everyone they held dear. Duryodhan and all of the Kauravas had died, as had all of the menfolk of Draupadi's family, including all of her sons by the Pandavas. The now-dead Karna was revealed to be a son of Kunti's from before her marriage to Pandu, and thus, the eldest Pandava and the rightful heir to the throne. The grand old man, Bheeshm, lay dying; their teacher Drona was dead as were several kinsfolk related to them either by blood or by marriage. In about 18 days, the entire country lost almost three generations of its men. It was a war not seen on a scale before, it was the Great Indian war, the Maha-bharat.<br>
    After the war, Yudhishthir became king of Hastinapur and Indraprastha. The Pandavas ruled for 36 years, after which they abdicated in favour of Abhimanyu's son, Parikshit. The Pandavas and Draupadi proceeded on foot to the Himalayas, intending to live out their last days climbing the slopes heavenwards. One by one, they fell on this last journey and their spirits ascended to the heavens. Years later, Parikshit's son succeeded his father as king. He held a big sacrifice, at which this entire story was recited for the first time by a disciple of Vyasa called Vaishampayan.`,

export const Pandavas={
Definition:`Pandavas were the five powerful and skilled sons of Pandu, the King of Hastinapur and his two wives Kunti and Madri. Hastinapur is equated with the current modern Indian state of Haryana, south of New Delhi. The Pandavas - Yudhistira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva - are the central characters in the most applauded epic in Hinduism, the Mahabharata. The brothers were famously involved in the Kurukshetra War with their cousins the Kauravas over who would control the throne of Hastinapur, and were, ultimately, victorious.<br>
The birth of the Pandavas is supposedly traced back to 3229 BCE when Yudhistira was born, and to 3226 BCE when Nakula and Sahadeva were born. The most engaging story of the Pandavas can never be dissociated from the formation of social structures and political decisions of current India, due to the influence it has had in the way of functioning and inheriting the values of Dharma established during their reign. The story of the Pandavas influences many cultures, especially of India, in the way many Hindu households makes decisions, assess and implement the moral conclusions of their actions.`,

    {
name:"Birth of the Pandavas",
content:`The story of their birth is rather interesting and beyond the general notions of belief. Pandu had two wives, Kunti and Madri. A king was legally allowed to have multiple wives in those times. Interestingly, while hunting in the forest of Hastinapur, Pandu happened to hit with an arrow a copulating deer couple, who were in fact humans disguised as deer in order to enjoy making love in the open. The male deer was Rishi Kidamba who, having being pierced by the arrow, cast a curse on Pandu that he would die the moment he advanced to be intimate with a women. This seriously affected the two wives who were then not able to bear a biological child of their own through Pandu. Pandu then renounced his kingdom and lived in the forest as an ascetic, after giving the throne to his cousin/brother Dhritarashtra, the father of the 100 Kauravas, with whom the Pandavas would wage a war later.<br>
Surprisingly, Kunti had received a boon in her early adulthood from a fierce and renowned Rishi Durvasa that she could call any of the divine Gods and bear a child. This proved to be very useful and, through the use of mantras given to her by Durvasa, Kunti called upon Yama, the God of Death and Dharma, through whom she gave birth to Yudhistira. She then invoked the Wind God, Vayu, through whom she brought Bhima to the world, later she called Indra, who gave her Arjuna as another Pandava. She then felt pity for Madri, who would otherwise have no child if she did not help her, so with the help of the mantras Madri called upon the twin Ashvins, who bore her Nakula and Sahadeva. Thus, the five Pandavas were born through the combined grace of the curse on Pandu, the boon to Kunti, and the coming of the Gods who helped the two wives bear five children. All the Pandavas inherited divine qualities from their celestial fathers.<br>`

Lord Krishna, who was the son of Kunti's brother, plays an equally central role in supporting the Pandavas during their exile imposed cunningly by the Kauravas. During the Pandavas exile, the King of Drupada organised a contest, called Swayamvar, where his daughter, Draupadi, would marry the one who won the contest. The contest was to hit the eye of the circularly rotating fish in the sky - an imaginary construction - with a bow and string, by looking down on the image of the fish in a water pond below. To add a surprise, there was a sixth Pandava, Karna, who had been born when Kunti, while being single, had called the Sun God Surya to test the mantra, who gave her this magnanimous son. But being single and to save her identity from being maligned, Kunti reluctantly had to abandon Karna who was picked up by a childless couple who worked as a charioteer in Hastinapur. Karna was unmatchable in vigour, knowledge, deeds, charity, and skills of all kinds. Arjuna was the only match for him. Karna too turned up at the contest, but having been denied entry by Draupadi for being a son of unknown parents and a son of a charioteer, Arjuna was the only one to accomplish the feat and win the contest.`

export const Kauravas={
    Definition:`The Kauravas are the 100 sons of the King of Hastinapur, Dhritarashtra, and his wife Gandhari who played a significant role in the legendary Indian epic, the Mahabharata. Hastinapur is assumed to be the current modern state of Haryana, and Gandhar, to where Gandhari belonged, is assumed to be the current city of Kandahar in Afghanistan. In the Mahabharata, the actions and behaviour of the Kauravas and their rivals, the Pandavas, changed the course of history following the Kurukshetra War. The traditional timeline of the Kauravas is similar to those of the Pandavas, beginning from 3229 BCE to about 3138 BCE. The life story of the Kauravas is of significance in India and in Hinduism, as their conduct often gives birth to numerous interpretations about unethical and immoral indulgence and their consequences.<br>
    The name Kaurava comes from the lineage of Dhritarashtra's ancestor Kuru, a dynamic king and ruler of the earth to all its corners, hence the heirs of the Kuru lineage termed as Kauravas, which for instance, also includes the five Pandavas and the later discovered sixth Pandava, Karna. Since Pandu could not continue to remain the king of Hastinapur due to a curse, Dhritarashtra, his cousin-brother was made the king. Pandu's five sons chose to be called Pandava and not Kaurava. Dhritarashtra was blind from birth while Gandhari being a women of strong conviction and wanting to suffer her husband's share of blindness, covered her eyes by tying a silk robe when she married him which she would only open at her death. In addition to the 100 Kauravas, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari were also blessed with a single daughter called Dussala.<br>

Gandhari looked after his comforts and requirements, at which Dwaipayana was impressed and offered her a boon. The boons given by rishi's of divine merit never fail to come to fruition. He gave a boon to Gandhari that she would be blessed with 100 sons equal in might to her lord and accomplishments. Surprisingly, at the same time, Kunti, wife of Pandu, was also pregnant and soon gave birth to their first son, Yudhistira, before Gandhari could. To everyone's sad surprise, Gandhari's pregnancy went on for two years without any sign of delivery. Hearing of the birth of five divine looking sons of Kunti, Gandhari became furious with her condition and hit her abdomen hard. Soon after, she delivered not even one son, but a hard lump of mass which horrified everyone.<br>
            The urgency of giving birth to sons was hidden in the reason that whoever, of Kunti and Gandhari, gives birth to sons first, would probably be favoured for the Hastinapur throne in their succession plan. Gandhari went to Dwaipayana and complained about the lump of mass, and doubted the rishi's boon, to which Dwaipayana affirmed he had never spoken a lie even in jest. He then asked Gandhari to cut the lump of mass into 100 pieces and place it in 100 different pots filled with clarified butter and wait. On Gandhari's request of a daughter, the pieces were cut into 101. The boon finally fructified and the first Kaurava, Duryodhana, was born followed by his 99 brothers, of which Dushasana became his favourite, and daughter Dussala. Duryodhana's name means 'unconquerable', and when he was born several animals howled which was seen as a bad omen by Vidura, who advised Dhritarashtra to abandon this child but he did not. This decision would shape their future.`

            name:"Development of THE Kauravas",
            content:`The 100 Kauravas were brought up with overflowing love and care, especially from Dhritarashtra, but from their childhood they developed a dislike for the Pandavas, especially regarding the throne of Hastinapur. They all received their warfare training from Guru Drona, who also taught the Pandavas. Duryodhana was fortunate to learn mace fighting from Balarama, elder brother of Lord Krishna, who also taught the same to Bhima. They both turned out to be the best students of Balarama. Duryodhana was far too ambitious and greedy, and his maternal uncle Shakuni, brother of Gandhari, kept on feeding Duryodhana's narcissistic pride. Shakuni had pledged making his nephew Duryodhana the king of Hastinapur, due to his hatred toward Bhishma arising from an earlier conflict between the two kingdoms. Shakuni was to effect this by misleading the Pandavas, who were favourites among all, including Bhishma, the son of Ganga (The personification of the River Ganges in the Himalayas). Bhishma was the grand uncle of the Pandavas and Kauravas who favoured the Pandavas (read Yudhistira) to rule because of their merit, skills, knowledge, and righteous conduct – most essential for becoming a king – whereas the Kauravas (read Duryodhana), being falsely guided from childhood by Shakuni, were disqualified as unworthy to rule Hastinapur.`

            name:"Rivalry with The Pandavas",
            content:`This rivalry with Pandavas was inbred in the Kauravas but the Pandavas were cordial, and Yudhistira, being the most righteous, always offered to settle the conflict through dialogue and also agreed to take less, if ever there was a partition to come. That said, the Kauravas were notorious for nurturing a desire to kill the Pandavas. They, through their unrighteous but cunning conduct along with the help of Shakuni, were able to send the Pandavas into exile for 13 years.<br>For a sacrificial event, the Pandavas were sent to a newly built palace where they were to stay and accomplish their ritual fulfilment. Duryodhana purposely built the palace of lacquer and intended to burn the Pandavas and their mother Kunti while they slept at night. This plan failed as the Pandavas being skilled and brave, found a way underneath the earth and with their strength and power they escaped through a tunnel. However, they decided to remain unknown to the world and let the news of their supposed death in the fire stand undisputed.<br>
            Duryodhana eventually found out that the Pandavas were alive during the archery competition organised by Drupada to find a suitable match for his daughter Draupadi. Arjuna won the competition, since he was the only one who could complete the task apart from his friend Karna. It was later decided that the Pandavas would keep a barren, often considered cursed land, to be their new kingdom and settle the throne dispute. The Pandavas went on to build a magnificent palace, even grander than Hastinapur, with the help of the gods Vishwakarma and Indra, and was named as Indraprastha. Indraprastha is assumed to be located where the present city of New Delhi stands. Duryodhana could not stomach the endless prosperity of the Pandavas. Such was their fame that common citizens of Hastinapur wanted to resettle in Indraprastha. Duryodhana was insulted during Yudhistira's Indraprastha coronation ceremony, so he pledged to take revenge against the Pandavas, especially Draupadi, who laughed when Duryodhana fell down unknowingly in a pond disguised as a hard floor in the magical palace.<br>
            Duryodhana invited the Pandavas to a game of dice and was able to win everything owned by them, with the help of Shakuni. Yudhistira, after selling himself and all his four brothers had Draupadi offer herself in the game and so lost her too. Dushasana started undressing Draupadi, since she was now a servant of Duryodhana, right in the middle of the court full of righteous and unrighteous kings. Being requested by Bhishma and others, Dhritarashtra did not order Duryodhana to stop the drama, mainly due to his ignorance and excess love for his children. Lord Krishna magically saved Draupadi by making her saree unending and Dushasana fainted since her saree became infinite in length. At this every moment, the Pandavas were sentenced to exile for 12 years with one additional year of hidden exile, and this would again continue for 13 more years on top if anyone of the Pandavas or Draupadi were identified during the last year of exile. This tricky exile imposition was planned by Duryodhana and Shakuni to keep the Pandavas revolving in unending exile.<br>When the exile was announced, Bhima, the second Pandava, in a fierce ecstasy of wrath vowed to kill all the 100 sons of Dhritarashtra and to drink Dushasana's blood from his chest after thrashing him and wash Draupadi's untied hair with that blood. The Kauravas were fearful at this vow because they knew the strength of Bhima who was assuredly matchless by the Kauravas, except Duryodhana. Vikarna, the third Kaurava, the only one following righteousness, questioned the disrobing of Draupadi, and also made a remark about the doom of the Kuru lineage if it was not possible to protect their sister-in-law.`

            name:"The Kurukshetra War",
            content:`Duryodhana with all his armies and reach could not discover the Pandavas in their 13th year of exile, since they lived with concealed identities in the kingdom of Virata. The exile ended with the starting of the great Kurukshetra War which shaped history. Duryodhana took to war with unwavering confidence only because of Bhishma, Karna, and Guru Drona taking his side in the conflict, primarily due to the kingdom's rules which compelled them, for they were righteous and followers of Dharma.

<br>Bhima was fierce in killing the Kauravas and he killed 98 of them easily, with Dushasana and Duryodhana remaining. Dushasana was killed as per Bhima's pledge and he ended up drinking a small amount of blood from his chest, a scene which demoralised Duryodhana and Shakuni but he soon reaffirmed his stand in the war. Vikarna was the only Kaurava on whose death, Bhima lamented and cried since he was a just warrior but fought for Duryodhana only to fulfil his duty. Duryodhana was full of excess pride and heightened confidence in all his unrighteous acts since his only goal was to kill the Pandavas by any means and snatch the throne of Hastinapur. Had he become the king, the lineage would be full of immoral and unethical kings and the consequences would have been devastating. Lord Krishna sensing this, managed to help the Pandavas in winning the war. When Duyodhana alone was left as a warrior, his mother Gandhari asked him to come naked and she would open her silk robe for the first time after decades and shield Duryodhana by sending divine energy from her eyesight making him undefeatable and invincible. Lord Krishna being even more resourceful and shamed Duryodhana when he was walking naked after bathing in the sea to see his mother, which made Duryodhana wear a large leaf robe around his waist. Gandhari opened her eyes and sent all her divine energy, not knowing that Duryodhana was wearing a robe making that portion bereft of the power of invincibility.<br>The fight between Duryodhana and Bhima, who were both great mace fighters, was upfront and aggressive, where both showed all their skills in warfare. Duryodhana seemed to be undefeatable and Bhima was losing. Krishna then hinted to Bhima to hit him on the waist where he was weak, though hitting below the waist was a breach of the rule of war, but since it was to end the lawlessness of Duryodhana and his lineage, it was necessary to kill him by twisting the rules. Duryodhana was killed and the Pandavas ruled Hastinapur for 35 years before they renounced everything to return to the woods and retire.<br>Since Kuru, the ancestor of the Hastinapur kingdom, had a boon that anyone of their heirs dying on their land would always reach heaven irrespective of their deeds, the Kauravas after their death were settled in heaven with their ancestors.<br>`
